# Transformer Building Blocks

Transformer-based generative AI deep neural networks (DNNs) are built upon several key components. Here's a breakdown of the essential building blocks:

**1. Tokenization:**

* This is the initial step where input data (like text) is broken down into smaller units called "tokens." These tokens can be words, subwords, or even individual characters.
* This process converts raw data into a format that the model can understand.

**2. Embeddings:**

* Tokens are then converted into numerical vectors called "embeddings." These vectors represent the semantic meaning of the tokens in a high-dimensional space.
* Essentially, embeddings translate words into a numerical form that the neural network can process.

**3. Positional Encoding:**

* Transformers process data in parallel, which means they don't inherently understand the order of tokens in a sequence.
* Positional encoding adds information to the embeddings that indicates the position of each token in the sequence. This allows the model to understand the context and relationships between words.

**4. Attention Mechanism (Specifically, Self-Attention):**

* This is the core innovation of transformers. It allows the model to weigh the importance of different tokens in a sequence when processing each token.
* "Self-attention" enables the model to focus on relevant parts of the input when making predictions.
* Multi-head attention is a variation that allows the model to attend to different aspects of the input simultaneously.

**5. Feed-Forward Neural Networks:**

* After the attention mechanism, the processed information is passed through a feed-forward neural network.
* This network further transforms the representations and helps the model learn complex patterns.

**6. Encoder-Decoder Architecture (in some Transformers):**

* Some transformer models, like those used for translation, use an encoder-decoder architecture.
    * The encoder processes the input sequence and creates a representation of it.
    * The decoder then uses this representation to generate the output sequence.
* Decoder only models, like many LLM's, only utilize the decoder portion of the architecture.

**7. Layer Normalization and Residual Connections:**

* These techniques help to stabilize and accelerate the training process.
    * Layer normalization helps to keep the activations of the network within a reasonable range.
    * Residual connections allow the model to learn more easily by providing "shortcuts" for information to flow through the network.

In essence, these building blocks work together to enable transformers to effectively process and generate complex data, particularly in natural language processing and generative AI applications.
