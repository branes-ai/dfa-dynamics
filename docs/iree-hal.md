# IREE Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

IREE's Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) is a crucial component that enables it to run machine learning models on diverse hardware. The HAL provides a consistent interface, abstracting away the specifics of different hardware devices and APIs. Here's a breakdown of IREE's key HAL drivers:

**1. Local HAL Driver:**

* This driver is primarily for CPU execution. It allows IREE to run compiled code on the host CPU.
* It provides a straightforward way to execute computations directly on the CPU's processing cores.
* This driver is essential for general-purpose CPU deployments and for scenarios where GPU acceleration is not available or desired.

**2. Task HAL Driver:**

* The task HAL driver is designed to handle asynchronous execution and task scheduling.
* It enables IREE to distribute workloads across multiple threads or processing units, improving parallelism and performance.
* This driver is particularly useful for optimizing the execution of complex models with many operations.
* This driver is heavily used to manage the execution of work across many cpu cores.

**3. Vulkan HAL Driver:**

* This driver leverages the Vulkan API to enable GPU acceleration.
* Vulkan is a cross-platform API that provides low-level access to GPUs, allowing IREE to achieve high performance on a wide range of GPU devices.
* The Vulkan HAL driver is crucial for deploying IREE on devices with GPUs, such as desktops, laptops, and mobile devices.
* This driver allows IREE to run compiled shader code on a GPU.

**Key Points:**

* The HAL drivers provide a layer of abstraction that allows IREE to be portable across different hardware platforms.
* Each driver is optimized for a specific type of hardware or execution model.
* By choosing the appropriate HAL driver, developers can tailor IREE to their specific deployment requirements.
* These HAL drivers are what allows IREE to be so flexible in it's deployment.

I hope this explanation is helpful!

# HAL Target flexibility

Can you run any of these targets from any source? The answer is nuanced and depends on how you interpret "any source."

**General Principles:**

* **HAL Abstraction:**
    * The core purpose of the HAL is to abstract away hardware-specific details. This, in principle, allows IREE to run compiled modules on any supported hardware.
    * However, the "source" of the compiled module plays a significant role.
* **Compilation Targets:**
    * IREE's compiler generates target-specific code. This means that a module compiled for a CPU will be different from a module compiled for a GPU.
    * Therefore, you cannot take a VMFB compiled for Vulkan and expect it to run directly on the local CPU HAL driver, and vice versa.

**Specific Scenarios:**

* **Local HAL Driver (CPU):**
    * You can generally run CPU-compiled modules from various sources (e.g., models imported from TensorFlow, PyTorch, or ONNX) on the local HAL driver.
    * The local HAL driver is quite versatile and can handle a wide range of CPU-based computations.
* **Task HAL Driver (CPU):**
    * Similar to the local HAL driver, the task HAL driver operates on CPU-compiled modules.
    * It enhances CPU execution by providing task-based parallelism.
    * Therefore any source that can run on the local hal driver will also run on the task hal driver.
* **Vulkan HAL Driver (GPU):**
    * The Vulkan HAL driver requires modules that have been compiled to Vulkan-compatible bytecode (e.g., SPIR-V).
    * Therefore, the source model must be processed by IREE's compiler with a Vulkan target.
    * You cannot directly run CPU-compiled modules on the Vulkan HAL driver.
    * The source model must be able to be lowered to vulkan shader code.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Target Compilation:**
    * The most critical factor is the target architecture specified during compilation.
    * IREE's compiler must generate code that is compatible with the target HAL driver.
* **Data Transfer:**
    * When using the Vulkan HAL driver, data transfer between the host CPU and the GPU is essential.
    * IREE handles these data transfers, but the overhead of data transfer can impact performance.
* **Model Compatibility:**
    * Not all machine learning models can be efficiently executed on all hardware targets.
    * Some models may have operations that are not supported by certain HAL drivers.

**In summary:**

* While IREE's HAL provides a degree of hardware abstraction, you cannot run arbitrary compiled modules on any HAL driver.
* The compilation target must match the HAL driver's capabilities.
* CPU HAL drivers (local and task) are more versatile, while the Vulkan HAL driver requires GPU-specific compilation.

# Compile Target vs Execution Target

You cannot directly turn a Vulkan target compiled MLIR (and thus a VMFB containing Vulkan-specific bytecode) into a VMFB that can be executed by a CPU local or task HAL driver. Here's why:

* **Hardware-Specific Compilation:**
    * When you compile for a Vulkan target, the IREE compiler generates code (typically SPIR-V) that is specifically designed to run on a GPU using the Vulkan API.
    * This code is fundamentally different from the machine code that a CPU can execute.
    * CPU HAL drivers (local and task) expect CPU-compatible machine code.
* **Architectural Differences:**
    * GPUs and CPUs have vastly different architectures. GPUs are designed for parallel processing of large amounts of data, while CPUs are designed for general-purpose computation.
    * The compiled code reflects these architectural differences.
* **HAL Driver Compatibility:**
    * HAL drivers are designed to interact with specific hardware. The Vulkan HAL driver interacts with GPUs, while the local and task HAL drivers interact with CPUs.
    * They cannot interpret or execute code that is not designed for their respective hardware.

**In essence:**

* A VMFB is a container for compiled code. The code inside the container must match the hardware that the HAL driver is designed to work with.
* To run the same model on a cpu, you would need to compile the original MLIR with a cpu target. That would then create a VMFB that is compatible with the cpu hal drivers.

Therefore, you must compile your MLIR for the specific target hardware that you intend to run it on.
