I have a convex hull defined by a set of constraints. The constraints are defined in the object's native reference frame. My task is to reorient the convex hull, and with it the constraints that define it, to a new global space. This will involve a rotation and a translation, so clearly a homogeneous coordinate system to express this transformation is preferred. The reorientation is going to be determined by a directional vector that will come from a different subsystem, and we will need to align a particular face of the convex hull along this directional vector, that is, the normal of the face will need to align. 

As example, and test case, we take the task of aligning two 3D rectangular prisms in a global coordinate space. The prisms are defined by the following vertex coordinates:

v0: (0 0 0)
v1: (m 0 0)
v2: (m 0 k)
v3: (0 0 k)

v4: (0 n k)
v5: (0 n k)
v6: (m n 0)
v7: (m n k)

These are the vertices of a Convex Hull defined by the constraints Ax <= b
-x <= -1
x <= m
-y <= -1
y <= n
-z <= -1
z <= k

This convex hull represents the domain of computation of a tensor product A(mxk) * B(kxn) = C(mxn).
The face at z = k, represents the output tensor Cout. This face, defined by the vertices 2, 3, 4, and 7
has a normal [ 0 0 1] in a right handed reference frame rooted in vertex 3, with vertex 2 and 4 providing
the reference vertices to define the right handed coordinate system.

This face needs to be aligned to another prism, with the same dimensions, in a left to right flow in the
global coordinate space. Left to right is the defined as the incremental progression in the y direction.
Thus the face representing Cout, that is z = k and normal [ 0 0 1 ] in the first prism, need to be reoriented
to a face that is at y = k with normal [ 0 1 0 ] in the global coordinate space.

The transformed vertices of the realigned prism would be

v0': (0 0 n)
v1': (m 0 n)
v2': (m k n)
v3': (0 k n)

v4': (0 k 0)
v5': (0 0 0)
v6': (m 0 0)
v7': (m k 0)

The second prism would need to be reoriented in the same way, but then placed in the global coordinate system
to the right of the first transformed prism with a 1 grid point spacer.

Can you give me a program that accomplished this transformation?
