# Source directory

The `./src` directory contains the different libraries that contain the functionality of modeling and analyzing Domain Flow Architecture systems.

The input to DFA systems are systems of Affine Recurrence Equations. 
These systems represent inherently parallel execution schedules that
are implicit to the read dependencies defined in the recurrence equations. 
To work with these systems, the parallelism needs to be analyzed and organized.
