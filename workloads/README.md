# Workloads

The Domain Flow Graph is a compute graph abstraction that can be used to define a computational pipeline.

There are importers to read in MLIR and produce a DFG, but it is also possible to create them programmatically.

This directory contains workload generators that capture and/or symbolize working with domain flow graphs.
