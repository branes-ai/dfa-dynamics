The MLIR code defines two functions: `simple_function` and `main`.

* **`simple_function`:**
    * Takes two input tensors: `%arg0` (shape 1x1x4) and `%arg1` (shape 1x4x4).
    * Creates a constant tensor `%0` with all elements equal to 1.0 (shape 1x1x4).
    * Performs an element-wise addition (`tosa.add`) of `%arg0` and `%0`, storing the result in `%add`.
    * Performs a matrix multiplication (`tosa.matmul`) of `%add` and `%arg1`, storing the result in `%2`.
    * Returns the result `%2`.
* **`main`:**
    * Creates two constant tensors: `%cst0` (shape 1x1x4) and `%cst1` (shape 1x4x4).
    * Calls `simple_function` with `%cst0` and `%cst1` as arguments.
    * Returns.

**Operator-by-Operator Analysis**

1.  **`tosa.const` (Constant Tensor Creation):**
    * This operator creates constant tensors with specified values and shapes.
    * In terms of arithmetic complexity, it's essentially a memory initialization operation. It doesn't involve additions or multiplications during runtime, rather during compile time.
    * `%0 = "tosa.const"() {value = dense<1.0> : tensor<1x1x4xf32>} : () -> tensor<1x1x4xf32>`
    * `%cst0 = "tosa.const"() {value = dense<[[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]]]> : tensor<1x1x4xf32>} : () -> tensor<1x1x4xf32>`
    * `%cst1 = "tosa.const"() {value = dense<[[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0],[5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0],[9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0],[13.0, 14.0, 15.0, 16.0]]]> : tensor<1x4x4xf32>} : () -> tensor<1x4x4xf32>`

2.  **`tosa.add` (Element-wise Addition):**
    * This operator performs element-wise addition between two tensors of the same shape.
    * Calculation: Each element of the first tensor is added to the corresponding element of the second tensor.
    * Arithmetic Complexity:
        * For tensors of shape (1x1x4), it performs 4 additions.
    * `%add = "tosa.add"(%arg0, %0) : (tensor<1x1x4xf32>, tensor<1x1x4xf32>) -> tensor<1x1x4xf32>`

3.  **`tosa.matmul` (Matrix Multiplication):**
    * This operator performs matrix multiplication between two tensors.
    * Calculation:
        * The input tensors are `%add` (shape 1x1x4) and `%arg1` (shape 1x4x4).
        * The output tensor `%2` has shape 1x1x4.
        * The calculation can be represented as:
            * $result[i,j,k] = \sum_{l=0}^{3} add[i,j,l] * arg1[i,l,k]$
    * Arithmetic Complexity:
        * For each element in the output tensor (1x1x4), there are 4 multiplications and 3 additions.
        * Total multiplications: 1x1x4x4 = 16 multiplications.
        * Total additions: 1x1x4x3 = 12 additions.
    * `%2 = "tosa.matmul"(%add, %arg1) : (tensor<1x1x4xf32>, tensor<1x4x4xf32>) -> tensor<1x1x4xf32>`

**Overall Complexity**

* The `simple_function` performs:
    * 4 additions (from `tosa.add`).
    * 16 multiplications and 12 additions (from `tosa.matmul`).
* The `main` function performs only constant creation and a function call, so the arithmetic complexity is dominated by the called function.

**Summary**

* `tosa.const`: Memory initialization, negligible runtime arithmetic complexity.
* `tosa.add`: Element-wise addition, linear complexity with the number of elements.
* `tosa.matmul`: Matrix multiplication, cubic complexity in the general case, here it is limited because of the 1x1 input dimensions.
