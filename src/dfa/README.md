# skeleton LIBRARY 

To make integration easier, the Domain Flow Architecture tool kit has become a C++ header-only library.
Before this it used to be a standard lib, and this directory holds the left over CMakeLists.txt file
and a couple of functionally empty cpp files.

If we need to reconstitute the dfalib, we can resume from here, but right now (3/29/2025) it is not
being used.
