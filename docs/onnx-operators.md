# ONNX Operators and OpSets

The C++ class definitions for ONNX operators can be found within the ONNX Runtime project. Here's a breakdown of how to locate them and what you'll find:

**1. ONNX Runtime Repository:**

  * **GitHub:** The primary source for the ONNX Runtime is on GitHub: [https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime)

**2. Core Operator Implementations:**

  * **`onnxruntime/core/providers`:** This directory contains the implementations of the core ONNX operators.
      * You'll find subdirectories for different execution providers (e.g., CPU, GPU).
      * Each operator typically has its own C++ file (e.g., `add_op.cc`, `matmul_op.cc`).
  * **Example:** `onnxruntime/core/providers/cpu/math/add_op.cc` would contain the C++ class definition and implementation for the `Add` operator on the CPU.

**3. Key Classes and Concepts:**

  * **`OpKernel`:** Base class for operator implementations. Derived classes implement the `Compute()` method to define the operator's logic.
  * **`KernelContext`:** Provides access to input and output tensors, attributes, and other relevant information within the operator's `Compute()` method.
  * **Tensors:** ONNX uses a specific tensor representation. You'll find classes related to tensor manipulation and data access.

**4. Navigating the Code:**

  * **Operator Sets:** ONNX operators are organized into operator sets with versions. This helps maintain compatibility as operators evolve.
  * **Namespaces:** The code is organized into namespaces (e.g., `onnxruntime::core::providers::cpu`) for clarity.

**Important Notes:**

  * **Complexity:** The ONNX Runtime codebase can be complex, especially for those new to it. Be prepared to spend time understanding the structure and key classes.
  * **Provider-Specific Implementations:** Operators may have different implementations for different hardware backends (CPU, GPU, etc.).
  * **Custom Operators:** If you're interested in defining your own operators, the ONNX Runtime provides mechanisms for that as well.

**Additional Tips:**

  * **Documentation:** The ONNX Runtime has documentation, although it may not always be up-to-date with the latest code changes.
  * **Search Tools:** Use GitHub's search functionality or your IDE's search tools to find specific operator definitions.
  * **Debugging:** If you need to understand how a particular operator works, you can try debugging the ONNX Runtime code.

Remember that the specific files and classes may change slightly as the ONNX Runtime evolves.
